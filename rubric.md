## Functionality
Meets Expectations. Although the application is a little light in functionality. The messaging works, and users are able to authenticate, create profiles, add friends and even message each other. I'm glad you were able to get alot of these social app mechanisms working! I would love to see more of the direction you want this app to head towards as far as things that will be unique to breakup buddy.

## User Interface
Meets expectations. I think some routing of the different social mechanics you have in your application could be done a bit better. But the UI is fairly intuitive. I would love to see more fluid interactions by integrating some more JS into your application. Additionally I'm curious to see which direction you head in with regard to integrating the ability to suggest activities. I hope you plan on continuing the work on this app because I love the proof of concept.

## Code Quality/Maintainability
Meets Expectations. I would love to see some more commenting and tests. These will help future Janice really dive deep into this code base and shore up some of the lose ends. Code that does exist within the application looks clean and properly indented.

## Evidence of Comprehension
Does not meet expectations. I think given some more time you could change this category very easily. I like the applications backend and it seems really solid. Unforunately there was no way for me to tell the effectiveness of your usage of JS as there was none. I hope to see a more polished version of this application that utilizes some of the things that were taught at the tail end of the course. Given more time, I have no doubts that you can accomplish this.
